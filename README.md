# Link prediction with machine learning

Machine learning can be done on graphs too. 
We can predict edges between vertices.

This is what i'm going to do

* create dataset for pairs of vertices
* make 1 for link, 0 for not link

See [rectangling network data](rectangling_network_data.md) for this part


After that, I try to predict links, which is hard!

See [tidymodels_link_prediction](tidymodels_link_prediction.md)
