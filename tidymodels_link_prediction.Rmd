Many things in the world are graphs, for instance real-life friendships, 
business interactions, links between webpages and social networks. 
I find graphs (the formal name for networks) fascinating and they are a secret 
obsession of me. I was introduced to the concepts and possibilities of those
graphs during my data-science traineeship and I've been interested since then.

I am also interested in machine learning and so the natural question becomes,
how can we do machine learning on graph data? 

This is part 2 of a [series about graphs and machine learning](README.md). 

**In this part I will build a simple model to predict links**

* Using [{tidymodels}](https://cran.r-project.org/package=tidymodels) (a meta package that also loads {broom}, {recipes}, {dials}, {rsample}, {dplyr}, {tibble}, {ggplot2}, {tidyr}, {infer}, {tune}, {workflows}, {modeldata}, {parsnip}, {yardstick}, and {purrr})


# Loading packages and data

```{r}
library(tidymodels)
```

Load data 

```{r}
enriched_trainingset <- readr::read_rds(file="data/enriched_trainingset.Rds")
head(enriched_trainingset)
```

THIS IS WHERE I WOULD SPEND A LOT OF TIME FIGURING OUT THE RELATIONSHIPS
BETWEEN OUTCOME AND FEATURES. LOTS OF PLOTS, LOTS OF CORRELATIONS ETC. 


```r
## usemodels is super easy to just format the basic needs for modeling! 
# usemodels::use_glmnet(enriched_trainingset, target~., verbose = FALSE, tune=FALSE, prefix = "ntwrk")
```

## Feature engineering

This is a set of steps to make sure we predict with only the features
that matter. 
Every row of this dataset is a 'possible' link (edge) between two nodes. We know from
both nodes the pagerank score, degree, betweenness, eigen-centrality and 
bridge score. In an actual setting you would know more than only network features, 
you could maybe see where someone lives, history on the site, and many more features!

After some exploration (not showed here), I decided to create some interactions
between page rank of two nodes, and the degree of the nodes, drop the identifiers
to and from and make the target a factor. Furthermore I drop correlated features
and normalize and center all features (there are no nominal variables in this
dataset).

_This recipe is only a plan of action, nothing has happened yet._

```{r}
# make it very simple first.
ntwrk_recipe <-
  recipe(enriched_trainingset,formula = target~.) %>% 
  recipes::update_role(to, new_role = "other") %>% 
  recipes::update_role(from, new_role = "other") %>% 
  step_rm(starts_with("betweenness")) %>% 
  step_rm(starts_with("eigen")) %>% 
  step_rm(starts_with("br_score")) %>% 
  step_interact(terms = ~ pg_rank:pg_rank_to) %>% 
  step_interact(terms = ~ degree:degree_to) %>% 
  #step_corr(all_numeric()) %>% 
  #step_nzv(all_predictors()) %>% 
  step_normalize(all_predictors(), -all_nominal()) %>% 
  step_mutate(target = as.factor(target))
```

## model
So what are we going to do with the model? I'm using a logistic regression 
from [{glmnet}](https://cran.r-project.org/package=glmnet) and capture the steps
of data preparation and modeling into 1 workflow-object.

```{r}
ntwrk_spec <- 
  logistic_reg(penalty = tune(), mixture = 1) %>% # pure lasso
  set_engine("glmnet")

ntwrk_workflow <- 
  workflow() %>% 
  add_recipe(ntwrk_recipe) %>% 
  add_model(ntwrk_spec) 
```

## Train and test sets

I split the data into a test and train set, but making sure the proportion
of targets is the same in test and train data.
```{r}
### split into training and test set
set.seed(2345)
tr_te_split <- initial_split(enriched_trainingset,strata = target)
val_set <- validation_split(training(tr_te_split),strata = target, prop = .8)
```


## Model tuning
I don't know what the best penalty is for this model and data, so we have
to test different versions and choose the best one.

```{r}
## Setting up tune grid manually, because it is just one column
lr_reg_grid <- tibble(penalty = 10^seq(-4, -1, length.out = 30))
```


```{r}
ntwrk_res <-
  ntwrk_workflow %>% 
  tune_grid(val_set,
            grid = lr_reg_grid,
            control = control_grid(save_pred = TRUE),
            metrics = metric_set(roc_auc))
```

```{r}
## visualise results
ntwrk_res %>% 
  collect_metrics() %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = penalty, y = mean)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_line() + 
  labs(
    title="Penalty should be lower than 0.01",
    y= "Area under the ROC Curve"
    ) +
  scale_x_log10(labels = scales::label_number())+
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0.01, color="tomato3")
```
What are the best models

```{r}
## show best models
top_models <-
  ntwrk_res %>% 
  show_best("roc_auc", n = 5) %>% 
  arrange(penalty)
lr_best <- 
  ntwrk_res %>% 
  collect_metrics() %>% 
  arrange(penalty) %>% 
  slice(5)

pred_auc <- 
  ntwrk_res %>% 
  collect_predictions(parameters = lr_best) %>% 
  roc_curve(target, .pred_0) %>% 
  mutate(model = "Logistic Regression")
autoplot(pred_auc)+ ggtitle("mediocre performance")
```

It is not really that good. 

Let's use the best performing model and modify the current workflow,
by replacing the value
```{r}
### replace model with parameters set (still untrained)
top_models[1,]
ntwrk_spec_1 <- 
  logistic_reg(penalty = 0.003562248, mixture = 0.5) %>% 
  set_engine("glmnet")

## change model
updated_workflow <- 
  ntwrk_workflow %>% 
  update_model(ntwrk_spec_1)
```

HOW DOES IT PERFORM ON TEST DATA? THE DATA WE HELD OUT


Last fit is a special function from tune that fits data on the training set
and predicts on the testset.

```{r}
ntwrk_fit <- 
  updated_workflow %>% 
  last_fit(tr_te_split)


ntwrk_fit %>% 
  collect_predictions() %>% 
  roc_curve(target, .pred_0) %>% 
  autoplot()+ 
  labs("Well, at least the test performance is equivalent to the training score")
```

Unpacking predictions. Soo we always predicted no connection!

```{r}
ntwrk_fit$.predictions[[1]] %>% 
  group_by(target, .pred_class) %>% 
  summarize(
    count = n(),
    avg_prob1 = mean(.pred_1),
    avg_prob0 = mean(.pred_0)
  )
```



This is problematic.

# Undersampling for better performance.

```{r}
# use specialized package for sampling methods.
# I'm now just undersampling, but you could create synthetic data too.
# 
library(themis) # install.packages("themis")
ntwrk_recipe_undersample <-
  recipe(enriched_trainingset,formula = target~.) %>% 
  recipes::update_role(to, new_role = "other") %>% 
  recipes::update_role(from, new_role = "other") %>% 
  step_rm(starts_with("br_score")) %>% 
  step_interact(terms = ~ pg_rank:pg_rank_to) %>% 
  step_interact(terms = ~ degree:degree_to) %>% 
  step_interact(terms = ~ eigen:eigen_to) %>% 
  step_corr(all_predictors()) %>% 
  step_normalize(all_predictors(), -all_nominal()) %>% 
  step_mutate(target = as.factor(target)) %>% 
  step_downsample(target,under_ratio = 1.5)
```


```{r}
ntwrk_spec2 <- 
  logistic_reg(penalty = tune(), mixture = tune()) %>% 
  set_engine("glmnet")

ntwrk_workflow2 <- 
  workflow() %>% 
  add_recipe(ntwrk_recipe_undersample) %>% 
  add_model(ntwrk_spec2) 

tune_grid <- grid_latin_hypercube(
  penalty(),
  mixture(), 
  size = 15
)
crossvalidation_sets <- vfold_cv(training(tr_te_split),v = 3, strata = target)

```

```{r, heavy computation here}
ntwrk_res2 <-
  ntwrk_workflow2 %>% 
  tune_grid(crossvalidation_sets,
            grid = tune_grid,
            control = control_grid(save_pred = TRUE),
            metrics = metric_set(roc_auc))
ntwrk_res2
```


Visualise results

```{r}
ntwrk_res2 %>% 
  collect_metrics() %>%
  select(mean, penalty:mixture) %>%
  pivot_longer(penalty:mixture,
               values_to = "value",
               names_to = "parameter"
  ) %>%
  ggplot(aes(value, mean, color = parameter)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.8, show.legend = FALSE) +
  facet_wrap(~parameter, scales = "free_x") +
  labs(x = NULL, y = "AUC")
```

```{r}
show_best(ntwrk_res2, "roc_auc")
best_auc <- select_best(ntwrk_res2, "roc_auc")
```



```{r}
final_workflow <- finalize_workflow(
  ntwrk_workflow2,
  best_auc
)
final_workflow
```

```{r}
library(vip)

final_workflow %>%
  fit(data = testing(tr_te_split)) %>%
  pull_workflow_fit() %>%
  vip(geom = "point")
```

```{r}
final_res <- last_fit(final_workflow, tr_te_split)
collect_metrics(final_res)
```

```{r}
final_res$.predictions[[1]] %>% 
  group_by(target, .pred_class) %>% 
  summarize(
    count = n(),
    avg_prob1 = mean(.pred_1),
    avg_prob0 = mean(.pred_0)
  )
```


hahahaah even worse!

I still never predict 1.
